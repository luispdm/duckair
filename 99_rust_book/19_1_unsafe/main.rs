     * Unsafe Rust exists for two reasons:
     * 1. static analysis is conservative by nature: Rust will reject a program if it can't guarantee
     * that is memory safe, even though, you, the programmer, know that the program is memory safe
     * 2. the underlying computer hardware is inherently unsafe
     *
     * The unsafe keyword gives you five superpowers:
     * 1. dereference raw pointers
     * 2. call an unsafe function or method
     * 3. access or modify a mutable static variable
     * 4. implement unsafe traits
     * 5. access fields of unions
     * The unsafe keyword doesn't turn off the borrow checker nor does it turn off Rust's safety checks.
     * Unsafe code is not dangerous, but the responsibilty for handling memory appropriately
     * is passed onto the programmer, which can, sometimes, create unexpected behaviour and bugs.

    /*
     * Raw pointers:
     * 1. can bypass Rust borrowing rules (there can be multiple mutable refs or
     * mutable and immutable refs at the same time)
     * 2. it is not guaranteed that they point to valid memory
     * 3. are allowed to be null
     * 4. don't implement any type of automatic cleanup
     *
     * Raw pointers might lead to data races.
     * Raw pointers are useful when interacting with C code or when creating safe abstractions
     * around unsafe code (more on that later).
